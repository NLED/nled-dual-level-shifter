This dual channel level translator(shifter) is used to convert 3.3 volt signals to 5 volt signals. It features 
on-board low drop out linear regulators for both the 5 volt and 3.3 volt rails. That allows it to support a VIN 
of up to 12 volts, which makes it easy to connect to other devices. The TXS0102 I.C. allows speeds up to 24Mbps, 
designed specifically for addressable LED pixels which utilize clock and data lines, or other types of SPI based 
communication. The layout of the board allows it to be used inline with standard wiring for adressable pixels, 
no tricky wiring or jumping.
